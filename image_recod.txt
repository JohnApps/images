Develop and train a model to recognize the content of JPG files in the folder O:\Bilder\1-D7100\2015-06-23-Bonmont
For each image and iteration collect CPU time, elapsed time and number of I/Os

Display each image being examined along with the interpretation of that image 
and solicit percentage accuracy from 0 to 100 from the terminal, 100% being the most accurate, 0% being
completely false interpretation. Each iteration has to achieve at least 50% accuracy prior to 
continuing.

store the results of each image and iteration in a Duck DB database called images.db

The cost of a CPU second is EUR 1.0, the cost of an I/O is EUR 0.1 
and elapsed time seconds cost EUR 0.001  of 

provide a summary for each image interpreted and display the summary on the terminal 
along with storing the data in the DuckDB database.

Finally, graphically display the major statistics for each image
